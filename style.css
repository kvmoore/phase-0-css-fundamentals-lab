-Jazz up our navigation links: Let's center all of our nav links as well. Give all of the <a> tags within our navbar padding of 10px on their left and right sides. In addition, change their background color to something of your choosing. We chose grey!

-Our image caption needs work: Let's shrink that font size down and make sure it is centered.

-Update the text block: Wouldn't it look nicer if our text was centered as well? Our image is about 900px wide, so let's give all our <p>s within #featured-property a hard width of 800px and center the text in there. Be sure to keep a little vertical space around the <p>s.

-Make our #details section horizontal: The details section could go nicely as a footer to the page, instead of a vertical list. To do this, make each of the <div>s float to the left.

-As a finishing touch: Let's clean up the <div>s at the bottom of the page. All of them should have the same background color, centered text, and occupy 25% of the width of the bottom row (since we have 4 divs).*/
